## Project Description


This a web application used to make orders in Epoka cantina for every student, teacher and others that comes in Epoka. Aim of this website is to make  easy order online for every one, fast preparation and no one have to wait in queue. Also this prgram will help sellers to prepare oders faster and easier without confusing customers. Each customer will be live notified by seller using contact number and after  purchasing their orders, their data will be removed. This will help also the website to preform faster with less date to handle. In the other hand the website will contain admin (super user) that will take care for product, bills, finance, inventars, product supplies, sellers.
Each user will have its web page. For customer (students, staff, others) with be mobile form and for sellers and admin will be computer form.
